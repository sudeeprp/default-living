# Conversations in Distress

We all have lost something.

Sometimes it is a lost opportunity, a sentiment of regret -
If only I had done something..., I shouldn't have...

Sometimes it's the loss of someone near to us.

Sometimes we worry losing what we already have:
Relations, power, goodwill, wealth...

> Our thoughts reflect the sentiment of distress with
> words like 'should', 'could', 'shouldn't'.

Given a sentence conveying our sentiment of distress,
I want to explore what the
[Gita-bhashya](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/ACover.html)
has to say about it.

How can the analytics help?

A sentiment-analysis on each sentence will tell us if the sentence conveys
distress. Searching for distress-loaded sentences will probably give
[Arjuna's predicament in the first chapter](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%201.html#26) -
his discomfort on realizing that his relatives are the enemy and
thinking of the loss that comes from confronting them.

How does Lord Krishna address our distress?
Can we employ a model to thread the Lord's responses
in different chapters? Sentences in this thread wouldn't
have a sentiment of distress.

To start, how about taking the distress and pulling it apart?

## Regret

Regret is one form of distress. In
[3-37](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#37),
Krishna describes desire as the cause of regret. In
[3-38](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#38),
He says everyone has it. In
[3-42](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#42),
He recommends abandoning it. In
[5-3](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%205.html#3),
He says that working without being driven is
the quickest way to look beyond desires

This thread would need a model to link 'regret' as a form of distress,
it would register the word 'desire' appearing in the same sentence,
perhaps link it as a cause. And then bring in the remedy to look beyond it.

Hang on, if we aren't driven by desire, and if we don't regret anything,
what would guide us? We all desire to gain or avoid
some consequences of our work.

The model would then need to recognize the link between
'desire' and 'consequences'
(desires are always linked to consequences or 'outcomes')

What can it find about outcomes? Actually, a lot (100+ occurrences).
3-12 and 3-13 describe possessiveness towards outcomes as theft,
since everything happens for the Lords' worship. That means whatever we do,
we don't have exclusive ownership on the outcome, nor do we own the tools
used in making it happen.
Many things need to come together to make something happen.
Neither credit nor guilt belongs to us.

Still want to cling to your guilt to guide you? Be my guest.
However, there is another way to look at it.
But let's look at another form of distress before getting there.

## Worry

Worrying about losing something is another form of distress.

When worry gets strong, it becomes fear, which makes us irrational.
Fear is explained in
[16-1](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2016.html#1) -
'a discomfort that's experienced when we imagine the sadness of
undesirable happenings'
The commentary of that Shloka says what will get rid of our fear:
When we determine to follow the Lord's instruction, we are free of fear.
This, [along with 16-2 and 16-3](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2016.html#1)
describe the Lord's instructions.

When we go against those instructions, we tend to start showing-off.
For example, we may practice a rigorous discipline in our work, worship,
or investments. It is accompanied by a misconception that
we're doing all of it for our purpose - to prove that we are the best.
Any gain from such discipline comes with the 'fear' of losing it.
[(17-18)](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2017.html#18)

To link these concepts from 'worry', we need a model that links it to fear,
and then look for sentences that deal with fear and similar concepts.

What if we aren't driven by worry? Will we become careless?

## The other way

<<sthitaprajna...
Maybe about forgiveness, responsibility, outcomes...
