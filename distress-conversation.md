# Conversations in Distress

We all have lost something. Sometimes it is a lost opportunity -
'If only I had done something...', 'I should have...'
sometimes it is the loss of someone, sometimes time, or money.
We also fear losing what we already have:
Relationships, power, goodwill, wealth...

We can catch ourselves in this sentiment when we articulate words such as
'should' and 'could'.

Given a sentence conveying our sentiment of distress,
let's imagine we want to explore what the
[Gita-bhashya](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/ACover.html)
has to say about it.

Searching for distress-loaded sentences will probably give
[Arjuna's predicament in the first chapter](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%201.html#26) -
his discomfort on realizing that his relatives are the enemy and
thinking of all that could be lost by fighting them.

That's not what we need. We are looking for the Lord's response to our distress.

Can we use or train a model to search out the Lord's responses
in different chapters and thread them together?
Maybe about forgiveness, responsibility, outcomes...
Then progress towards

and [worship](https://<<)
