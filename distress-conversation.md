# Conversations in Distress

We all have lost something.

Sometimes it is a lost opportunity, a sentiment of regret -
If only I had done something..., I shouldn't have...

Sometimes it's the loss of someone near to us.

Sometimes we worry losing what we already have:
Relations, power, goodwill, wealth...

> Our thoughts reflect the sentiment of distress with
> words like 'should', 'could', 'shouldn't'.

Given a sentence conveying our sentiment of distress,
I want to explore what the
[Gita-bhashya](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/ACover.html)
has to say about it.

_How could a
<abbr title="an interpretation of data to draw inference">model</abbr> help?_

_A sentiment-analysis on each sentence will classify its sentiment as
distress, or not. Picking distress-loaded sentences will probably give
[Arjuna's predicament in the first chapter](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%201.html#26) -
his discomfort on realizing that his relatives are the enemy and
thinking of the loss that comes from confronting them._

> How does Lord Krishna address our distress?

_Can we employ a model to thread the Lord's responses
in different chapters? Sentences in this thread wouldn't
have a sentiment of distress._

To start, let's take two forms of distress - Regret and Worry.
Let's pull it apart.

## Regret

Regret is one form of distress. In
[3-37](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#37),
Krishna describes desire as the cause of regret. In
[3-38](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#38),
He says everyone has it. In
[3-42](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#42),
He recommends abandoning it. In
[5-3](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%205.html#3),
He says that
[working without being driven](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/karmayoga.html)
is the quickest way to look beyond desires

_If a model needs to construct this thread from an expression of regret,
it would need to locate 'regret' in
[3-37](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#37),
register the word 'desire' appearing in the same sentence,
perhaps link it as a cause. And then bring in the neighboring Shlokas,
ending the thread with the remedy in
[5-3](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%205.html#3)._

This thread brings a follow-up question,
especially if we intend to live according to it -

> If we aren't driven by desire, and if we don't regret anything,
what would guide us? We all desire to gain and avoid
the outcomes and consequences of our work.

_The model would then need to recognize the link between
'desire' and 'consequences'.
Desires are always linked to consequences and outcomes._

> What has the Lord said about outcomes?

Actually, a lot (100+ occurrences of the word 'outcome').
The Shlokas
[3-12](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#12)
and [3-13](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#13)
describe possessiveness as theft, with
[18-14 to 18-15](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#14)
listing the causes of any action.

From [18-17](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#17)
onwards, the Lord says that He is the basis of every performance.
Everything happens for the Lords' worship. That means whatever we do,
we don't have exclusive ownership on the outcome, nor do we own the tools
used in making it happen.

Many things need to come together to make something happen.
Neither the credit, nor the guilt belongs to us.

Still want to cling to your guilt to guide you?
There's another way to look at it.
Before that, let's look at another form of distress.

## Worry

Worry is an imagination of undesirable happenings.
When worry gets strong, it becomes fear, which makes us irrational.

Fear is explained in
[16-1](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2016.html#1) -
'a discomfort that's experienced when we imagine the sadness of
undesirable happenings'
The commentary of that Shloka gives the remedy for fear:
When we determine to follow the Lord's instruction, we are free of fear.
This, [along with 16-2 and 16-3](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2016.html#1)
describe the Lord's instructions.

When we go against those instructions,
[16-11](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2016.html#11)
says that we would take refuge in worry, considering the enjoyment of desires
as the ultimate goal.
In Shloka [17-18](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2017.html#18),
He says that we would tend to start showing-off, and connects this with fear.

For example, we may practice rigorous discipline in our work, worship,
or investments. It is accompanied by a misconception that
we're doing all of it for our purpose - to prove that we are the best.
Any gain from such discipline comes with the 'fear' of losing it.

_To link this thread from 'worry', we need a model that links it to fear,
and then look for sentences that deal with fear and similar concepts._

What if we aren't driven by worry? Will we become careless?

## The other way

We don't want to be in distress, guilt or worry. 
But without them, we are afraid that we would lose guidance.
Maybe, distress is useful?
We worry about dental health, so we get everyone to brush their teeth.
The guilt of overeating balances against evolutionary instincts to fill-up.
We worry about losing money, so we make profitable investments. 

Or do we?

When we are aware of ourselves and the risks involved in activity, we see
that everything is not in our control.
Indeed, many things need to come together to deliver any outcome.

By recognizing this, we are likely to prepare well and perform.
We would be players who enjoy their game
[(5-21)](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%205.html#21)
and develop focus
[(6-26)](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%206.html#26)
We wouldn't become players who keep worrying the opponent
and keep chasing changing perceptions, like in
[2-67](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#67).

When we know that the Lord enjoys every experience, we can choose how to
experience the outcome of our activity.
Do we grudge it? Do we fear losing it?
Or do we cherish the awareness that comes out of it - as the Lord says in
[4-33](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%204.html#33)?

With this, we wouldn't be burdened by distress. We would
[work without attachment](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/karmayoga.html)
to realize our full potential - as the Lord describes in
[2-72](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#72).

_As we saw here, we could use some help in linking concepts and gaining
new views of a subject. These links were made manually, not by a 
<abbr title="an interpretation of data to draw inference">model</abbr> yet.
The Gita-bhashya is vast and deep, so this project will construct a model
to make more views than what a person could achieve manually._
