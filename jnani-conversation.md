# Those who know

The fundamental law of the universe is the Lord.
Everything happens for its purpose. Its will is always realized.
The Gita is a part of the Mahabharata,
in which the Lord has taken a male form - as Lord Krishna.

'Those who know' are people who know this fact -

7-28

- The fact that all their activities are for the Lord's purpose
([3-11](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#11))
- The fact that the Lord is the essence of their Self.
