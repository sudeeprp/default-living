# Those who know

The fundamental law of the physical universe is
[a part of the Lord](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#6).
We are [a part of the Lord](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#6)
as well.
Everything happens for the [Lord's purpose](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#78).
Its will is always realized.

The Gita is a part of the Mahabharata,
in which the Lord happens to be seen in the male human form - as Lord Krishna.
He says this in [4-6](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%204.html#6).
Those who know this attain the Lord, as said in [4-9](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%204.html#9).

'Those who know' are people who know the true nature of the Self.
They know that its purpose is the Lord's purpose.
See [7-16](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#16),
where he lists four types of people who worship Him.

Following this, in
[7-17](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#17),
the Lord refers to 'those who know' as being dear to Him.

## Adoring the Lord

[4-11](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%204.html#11) says:
Whichever way we adore the Lord, He reciprocates in the same way.

Knowing that your purpose is the Lord's purpose, you would demonstrate dedication.
You would also recognize that its outcome is given by the Lord,
as He says in [7-22](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#22)

You would recognize your Self, your body and all activities of the environment
as His body. This is stated in
[8-3](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%208.html#3)

[6-27](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%206.html#27)
says that such recognition comes when you are rid of all flaws.

[9-30](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%209.html#30)
overrides this. The Lord says even if you aren't fortunate,
even if you are downright foul and offensive, you will worship without flaws
just by your resolve.

Once you are devoted to Him, the Lord devotes himself to you.
You will no longer need to bother about what's good for you, since He takes
that responsibility. Just follow the Lord's imperative and surrender to Him.
See [9-34](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%209.html#34)
and [18-66](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#66)

Whatever your purpose, whomever you work for -
it's the Lord's worship and He is the enjoyer
([3-11](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#11))

The Lord is the essence of your Self
([10-20](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2010.html#20))

What can we offer the Lord of the Universe? 'Anything and Everything',
He says in
[9-26](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%209.html#26)
and [9-27](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%209.html#27)

Everything we say is praise to Him, as Arjuna says in
[11-37](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2011.html#37) part 2
