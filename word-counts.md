# Exploring Word-counts

The Gita explains various concepts in a flow of chapters.
Here, we count words in each chapter and correlate them
by the distribution-patterns.

For example, here is the distribution of the word 'Self' (आत्मा):
<table>
<tr><td>Self</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.00);">01</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.32);">02</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.29);">03</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">04</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.27);">05</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.29);">06</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">07</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">08</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.01);">09</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">10</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.01);">11</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">12</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.38);">13</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.05);">14</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">15</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.01);">16</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.00);">17</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.05);">18</td></tr>
</table>
We see here, that the word 'Self' is mostly concentrated
in chapters 02, **03**, 05, 06, and **13**.

Let's take the next most-frequently occurring word, which is 'Lord' (परमात्म):
<table>
<tr><td>Lord</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.00);">01</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">02</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.25);">03</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.26);">04</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">05</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">06</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.26);">07</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.25);">08</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.24);">09</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.27);">10</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.28);">11</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">12</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.29);">13</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">14</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">15</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">16</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">17</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.29);">18</td></tr>
</table>
The word 'Lord' is concentrated around chapters **03**, 04, 07-11, **13** and 18. Krishna has described Himself pretty well here :)

So if you want to explore the relationship between your Self and the Lord,
you can start with the chapters where they both occur together -
[chapter 3](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html)
or [chapter 13](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2013.html).

Let's take one more word: Look at the distribution of the word 'body', which is the collection of molecules making up your body at this point in time.
<table>
<tr><td>body</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.00);">01</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.30);">02</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.24);">03</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">04</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">05</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">06</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">07</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.05);">08</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">09</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.01);">10</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">11</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">12</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.46);">13</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.24);">14</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">15</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.01);">16</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">17</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.25);">18</td></tr>
</table>
Again, chapter **03** and chapter **13** explore your relationship with your body and the Lord.
