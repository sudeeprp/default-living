# Word-counts trial

The Gita explains various concepts in a flow of chapters.
Here, we count words in the commentary of each chapter
and correlate them by their distribution-patterns.
Let's see the capabilities and limitations of this basic approach.

Here is the chapter-wise distribution of the word आत्मा,
[The Self](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Back%20to%20Basics.html):
<table>
<tr><td>Self</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.00);">01</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.32);">02</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.29);">03</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">04</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.27);">05</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.29);">06</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">07</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">08</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.01);">09</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">10</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.01);">11</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">12</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.38);">13</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.05);">14</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">15</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.01);">16</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.00);">17</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.05);">18</td></tr>
</table>
We see here, that the word 'Self' is mostly concentrated
in chapters 02, **03**, 05, 06, and **13**.

Let's take the next most-frequently occurring word, which is 'Lord' (परमात्म):
<table>
<tr><td>Lord</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.00);">01</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">02</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.25);">03</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.26);">04</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">05</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">06</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.26);">07</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.25);">08</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.24);">09</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.27);">10</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.28);">11</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">12</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.29);">13</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">14</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">15</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">16</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.03);">17</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.29);">18</td></tr>
</table>
The word 'Lord' is concentrated around chapters **03**, 04, 07-11, **13** and 18. Krishna has described Himself pretty well here :)

If you want to explore the relationship between your Self and the Lord,
you can start with the chapters where they both occur -
[chapter 3](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html)
or [chapter 13](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2013.html).

Sure enough, chapter 3 talks about our activities, purpose and the Lord

- [3-9](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#9):
Activity needs a purpose. Make the Lord's worship as your purpose.
- [3-11](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#11):
Whatever your purpose, whomever you work for - it's the Lord's worship and He is the enjoyer.
- [3-22](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#22):
Though the Lord isn't bound to any duty or purpose, He stays active to reassure us.
- [3-26](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#26):
Delight in your activity. It is part of the Lord's play.
- [3-30](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#30): Dedicate your activity to the Lord.
- [3-31](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#31): Even if we don't live this all the time, it is still sufficient to simply accept His existence.

In chapter 13, The Lord describes our relationship intimately:

- [13-2](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2013.html#2):
The Lord is the essence of the [Self](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Back%20to%20Basics.html),
The Lord is both the effect and the cause,
The Self and the environment are effects of the Lord's creation
- [13-12](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2013.html#12): By being the body of the Lord , It is in the very nature of the
[Self](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Back%20to%20Basics.html) to enjoy being under the service of the Lord

> It looks like the chapter-wise distribution helps us correlate the
> relationship between concepts.

## Do we miss something?

This method of correlating chapter-wise distributions can miss something.

For instance:

It missed [10-20](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2010.html#20),
in which The Lord describes our relationship:
'I am situated in all beings at their core as the Self.
Moreover, I am the beginning, as well as the end and everything in-between'

So the word 'Self' did occur in Chapter 10.
However, it didn't figure significantly -
that chapter has only 27 occurrences of the word, compared to a total
of 1503 occurrences in the entire commentary.

Another instance:

It would also miss [7-5](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#5).
Here the Lord describes that his ownership over the Self is special,
standing out as His ultimate nature:

'Know My ultimate nature, which is something distinct,
in the form of a conscious being by whom this world is sustained'.

The 'conscious being' is the Self.
That's inferred from the fact that the Self brings consciousness.
Perhaps none of the pre-trained models would make this correlation.
It would require re-training a model.

Let's take one more word: 'body'.
Look at its distribution:
<table>
<tr><td>body</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.00);">01</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.30);">02</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.24);">03</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">04</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">05</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">06</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">07</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.05);">08</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.02);">09</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.01);">10</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">11</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">12</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.46);">13</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.24);">14</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">15</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.01);">16</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.04);">17</td><td style="background-color: hsla(120,60%,70%,0.25);">18</td></tr>
</table>
Compare it with the highlights above.
Again, chapter **03** and chapter **13** deal with the body as well.
Let's look at our relation with our body in chapter 13.

Sure enough:

- [13-2](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2013.html#2):
A living body merely qualifies the Self and doesn't exist without it
- [13-5](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2013.html#5):
The body is a collection of elements formed since the birth of the universe
- [13-14](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2013.html#14):
The Self is the one which illuminates all organs
- [13-19](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2013.html#19):
Know the environment and the Self to be without a beginning.

What about chapter 3? Actually, it isn't so explicit about the body itself.
In that chapter, the Lord deals with the activities of the body -
as we saw above.

Perhaps there are other chapters and Shlokas describing the body itself.
The chapter-wise map of 'body' indicates that
[chapter 14](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2014.html#5)
would deal with it. The Lord describes the
[three qualities](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas)
in that chapter, adding that these qualities tie down the Self.
