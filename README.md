# Ramanuja's Gita-bhashya

The Gita narrates a conversation between Krishna and Arjuna
in a series of Shlokas.
The conversation deals with work, life, awareness, liberty, and the Lord.

[Ramanuja's commentary](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/ACover.html)
interprets and elaborates each Shloka. The commentary called the 'Gita Bhashya'

The purpose of this project is to 
discover the flow in the Shlokas and their interpretation. 
Such discoveries happen
when we read and interpret the Shlokas repeatedly.
We want to assist with repeated-reading using analytics and visualization.

The English translation of Ramanuja's Gitabhashya
forms the basis of the analysis. Before starting, may we suggest a quick read
of some [background](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Back%20to%20Basics.html)

Alright, let's start by [exploring word-counts](word-counts.md).
The top-two words in the Gita-bhashya are:
- आत्मा (pronounced aatma):
[The Self](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Back%20to%20Basics.html),
which is you
- परमात्म, प्रभु (paramaatma, prabhu): The Lord,
who owns the laws of the universe and everything else. It is Krishna.

Why would you converse with Lord Krishna? 

Krishna Himself says in [Chapter 7, Shloka 16](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#16):
'Four types of people worship Me: The distressed, the enterprising, the curious and those who know'.
Let's explore each of them.
- A conversation in [distress](distress-conversation.md) is about regaining something we've lost, or fear losing
- An [entrepreneurial](entrepreneur-conversation.md) conversation is about gaining something we don't have
- A conversation of [curiosity](curiosity-conversation.md) wishes to know the Self and its environment.
- Conversations of [those who know](jnani-conversation.md) are for the Lord's purpose.
