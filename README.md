# Ramanuja's Gita-bhashya

The Gita narrates a conversation between Krishna and Arjuna.
It deals with work, life, awareness, liberty, and the Lord.

The conversation is described in a series of Shlokas.
[Ramanuja's commentary](ramanujas-commentary.md)
interprets and elaborates each Shloka. 
The commentary is called the 'Gita-bhashya'.

The purpose of this project is to discover flows in the conversation.
These discoveries happen when we read and interpret the Shlokas repeatedly.
We discover relationships between concepts that we may have missed before.

The goal is to assist with repeated-reading and discovery
using analytics and visualization.

Let's start. The top-two words in the Gita-bhashya are:
- आत्मा (pronounced aatma):
[The Self](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Back%20to%20Basics.html),
which is **you**
- परमात्म, प्रभु (paramaatma, prabhu): The **Lord**,
who owns the laws of the universe, you, and everything else. It is Krishna.

## Why would **you** converse with **Lord Krishna**? 

Krishna Himself says in [Chapter 7, Shloka 16](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#16):
'Four types of people worship Me: The distressed, the enterprising, the curious and those who know'.
Let's explore each of them.
- A conversation in [distress](distress-conversation.md) is about regaining something we've lost, or fear losing
- An [entrepreneurial](entrepreneur-conversation.md) conversation is about gaining something we don't have
- A conversation of [curiosity](curiosity-conversation.md) wishes to know the Self and its environment.
- Conversations of [those who know](jnani-conversation.md) are for the Lord's purpose.
