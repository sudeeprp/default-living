The Gita narrates a conversation between Krishna and Arjuna
in [Shlokas](https://rapalearning.com/gita-shlokas).
The conversation deals with work, life, awareness, liberty, and the Lord.

Krishna explains some of these aspects in several chapters,
not necessarily in sequence.
[Ramanuja's commentary](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/ACover.html)
explores all of them.

The purpose of this project is to thread
and discover concepts in the Shlokas. 
This often happens when we read them again and again.
We want to help repeated reading with analytics and visualization.
 
Let's start by [exploring word-counts](word-counts.md).
The top-two words in this conversation are:
- आत्मा (pronounced aatma): The Self, which is you
- परमात्म (pronounced paramaatma): The Lord, who is Krishna

Why would you converse with Lord Krishna? 

Krishna himself says in [7-16](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#16):
'Four types of people worship Me: The distressed, the enterprising, the curious and those who know'.
Let's explore each of them.
- A conversation in [distress](distress-conversation.md) is about regaining something we've lost, or fear losing
- An [entrepreneurial](entrepreneur-conversation.md) conversation is about gaining something we don't have
- A conversation of [curiosity](curiosity-conversation.md) wishes to know the Self and its environment.
- Conversations of [those who know](jnani-conversation.md) are for the Lord's purpose.
