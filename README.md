# Exploring Krishna's Gita

This project is about exploring
Ramanuja's commentary on The Gita.

The Gita is a set of [Shlokas](https://rapalearning.com/gita-shlokas),
narrating the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna.
It deals with work, life, awareness, liberty, and the Lord.

Krishna explains each aspect in several contexts.
[Ramanuja's commentary](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/ACover.html)
explores all of them.

This project intends to thread them together with analytics and visualization.

Let's start by exploring word-counts.
See [words that tend to appear together](https://rapalearning.com/word-count-relations)
The top-two words in this conversation are:
- आत्मा (pronounced aatma): The Self, which is you
- परमात्म (pronounced paramaatma): The Lord, who is Krishna

Why would you converse with Lord Krishna? 

Krishna himself says in [7-16](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#16):
'Four types of people worship Me: The distressed, the enterprising, the curious and those who know'
- A conversation in [distress](distress-conversation.md) is about regaining something we've lost, or fear losing
- An [entrepreneurial](entrepreneur-conversation.md) conversation is about gaining something we don't have
- A [curiosity](curiosity-conversation.md) wishes to know about the Self and its environment.
- Conversations of [those who know](jnani-conversation.md) are for the Lord's purpose.

The analytics is done on
