# Conversations of curiosity

There are many mysterious things in this universe.
What is the biggest mystery? 

One part of the universe is a machine. It runs according to its laws,
some of which we have discovered.
There is one fundamental law behind all of them,
which is one part of the Lord.
The other part of the universe is us.
We are conscious beings who wonder about its mysteries.
We also form a part of the Lord, as He says in
[7-6](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%207.html#6).

**You**, who wonder about all those mysteries, is the biggest mystery :)

A conversation of curiosity is to inquire into your Self and
your relationship with the Lord.

These words - the
[**Self**](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Back%20to%20Basics.html#inlineapplnote0)
and the
[**Lord**](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#78) -
are the two most-often repeated
words in the Gita. One way to explore their relationship is to explore
the distribution of words across chapters.

The technique of [karmayoga is about working without attachment](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/karmayoga.html).
It has the awareness of the Self built into it, as the Lord says in
[3-17](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#17).
When our activity is not driven by addictions or obligations,
there is joy in our purpose. Like parents playing with their infant,
like a runner finds joy in running, a reader finds joy in reading,
we enjoy the moment. We live in our Self.

What else is there to the Self?

## Our intention

Our intention is for us to choose, as the Lord says in
[14-19](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2014.html#19).

We can let our intentions be driven by past experiences.
These experiences make the emotions in our body as 
[serenity in sattva](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2014.html#sattva),
[passion in rajas](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2014.html#rajas)
[lethargy in tamas](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2014.html#tamas).

When we let our intentions be driven by them, we reinforce those qualities,
as the Lord illustrates in
[2-62](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#62).

Our experiences are what we interpret as the 'outcomes' of our actions.
They also come from these qualities, which give
[the state of our body](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas)
at a point in time.

How does the same activity look under different intentions?

source of initiatives [18-18](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#18)| in sattva | in rajas | in tamas |
---|---|---|---
**awareness** | same attitude towards all beings [18-20](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#20) | vary by appearance and outcome [18-21](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#21) | pre-occupation, isolation [18-22](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#22) |
**goals** | Self-governed [18-23](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#23) | to fulfil desires [18-24](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#24) | ill-conceived [18-25](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#25) |

our principles | in sattva | in rajas | in tamas |
---|---|---|---

The intention we pick in our initiative, activities and principles
gives our experience -

our experience | in sattva | in rajas | in tamas |
---|---|---|---
the pursuit of happiness | enjoy repeatedly; poison at first, ripens into bliss [18-37](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#37) | bliss at first, ripens to poison [18-38](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#38) | infatuates and ends up confounding [18-39](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#39) |

It is the Lord who lets us have these emotions, as He says in
[10-4](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2010.html#4).

However, [4-14](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%204.html#14)
says that the Lord doesn't trap us. We are trapped by our expectations.

Whatever our situation, expectations, our emotions and experiences,
we choose our intention.
We can de-couple our intention from the body and its expectations,
focusing it on the Lord instead.
That is the natural state of the Self.

_This structure seems overwhelming with loads of information.
Can a model really bring this detail out? Perhaps a graph representation
would bring out a lattice linking the three qualities
to everyday experiences_
