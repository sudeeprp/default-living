# Conversations of curiosity

There are many mysterious things in this universe.
What is the biggest mystery? 

It is **you**, who wonders about all those mysteries :)

And of course, the fundamental law of the universe - the 'truth',
which made all this come into being - including you.

Such a 'law' would create and control everything -
So we call it the Lord. It controls its own discovery -
and our chance to find it as well.

A conversation of curiosity is to ask about ourselves and
our relationship with the Lord.

One way to explore the relationship is to explore the Gita-bhashya
using the distribution of words across chapters.

<<Discovering outselves with activity
<<How do we relate to activity?
<<We are our intention
<<Past activities live as sattva, rajas and tamas within us
<<What am I attached to, and why does it matter? <<table with qualities and discipline, charity 
<<Our interpretation is given by past activities
<<I give emotions: 10-4 to 10-5

<<The lord doesn't trap us - we are trapped by our expectations 4-14

<<akartaram avyayam

Can a model pull out contradictory statements about actions
and tie them together in activity?
