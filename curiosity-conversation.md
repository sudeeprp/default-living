# Conversations of curiosity

There are many mysterious things in this universe.
What is the biggest mystery? 

It is **you**, who wonders about all those mysteries :)

And of course, the fundamental law of the universe - the 'truth',
which made all this come into being - including you.

Such a 'law' would create and control everything -
So we call it the Lord. It controls its own discovery -
and our chance to find it as well.

A conversation of curiosity is to ask about ourselves and
our relationship with the Lord.

One way to explore the relationship is to explore the Gita-bhashya
using the distribution of words across chapters.
