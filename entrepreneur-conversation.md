# Conversations of an Entrepreneur

There are times when we keep aside all that we have,
including our fears.
The joy of a new creation or an enterprise masks all of that.
The 'enterprise' could be to create value, learn a tune,
teach something, make new friends or explore places.

> Our thoughts reflect the sentiment of enterprise with
> words like 'do', 'want', 'will', 'shall'.

Given a sentence conveying my thrill at starting something new,
I want to explore what the
[Gita-bhashya](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/ACover.html)
says about seeing it through.

## How do I keep my resolve, avoiding fatigue and variance?

Having started something new, it requires perseverance to see it through.
However, fatigue often comes in the way of a long pursuit.

We are also subject to variance - different people have different opinions.
Our instincts may tell us different things as well.
If we allow ourselves to be swayed, the variance will not lead us to our goal.

In all of this, our resolve reflects as the 'focus' in our actions,
bringing perseverance towards our goal.
That's if we have one goal, which can last the time of our pursuit.

Perseverance towards your
[**Self**](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Back%20to%20Basics.html#inlineapplnote0)
has the least variance, when it is separate from others and the environment.

See every activity as a journey of awareness and liberation. 
Without this viewpoint, variance sets in, as the Lord states in
[2-41](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#41).
The [Shlokas after this](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#42)
describe what that variance feels like.

In [10-36](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2010.html#36),
the Lord says that He is determination and perseverance. Whenever you
see yourself being determined and persevering, recognize Him within you.

In [2-67](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#67),
He says there's high variance in following the organs of our body.
The organs of our body are for our use during this lifetime.
We aren't meant to run behind their desires and pleasures.

_A model to link these concepts could relate the closeness between
resolve and perseverance; and recognize variance and fatigue as antonyms._

## If we don't run behind our pleasures, what do we run for?

In [2-40](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#40),
He had said that working without attachments will never go waste.

Yet, what is it about not following the organs of the body?
Arjuna asks this in
[3-1](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#1)

In [3-8](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%203.html#8),
the Lord recommends a bias to action -
saying that activity is superior to contemplation.
Isn't activity by-the-body, for-the-body?

The Lord states the other face of activity in
[4-33](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%204.html#33):
Every activity, without exception, culminates in knowledge.
When we pick this awareness in all our activities -
instead of running to satisfy our body -
we see constant progress.
Learning by doing is better than contemplation.

_Modelling this question as a reluctance to action would need to link
Shlokas that recommend a bias to action._

## What's the use of liberty? What we need is commitment!

People who are totally attached to their work and outcomes may be blind
to alternatives. Usually, they get in their own way.
They aren't committed when the outcome is not guaranteed.
Outcomes aren't guaranteed - experiences rarely match our expectations exactly.
The Lord also states that in the famous
[2-47](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#47).

On the other hand, dispassionate, unattached people may be 'free',
but they don't bother to get anything done?

Lord Krishna responds in
[6-1](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%206.html#1):
People who don't need to run behind outcomes
are at liberty to chart their purpose.
They not without fire, neither are they idle.

In [4-39](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%204.html#39),
He said: A person who trusts is eagerly engaged and gains ultimate composure.

We can recognize a lack of trust in ourselves, when we behave like
[18-28](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#28):
A person who doesn't apply himself is ordinary, stiff and pretentious

Achieving anything requires many things to come together,
as the Lord says starting with
[18-14](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#14).

Once we have set a purpose, we need to get out of the way -
He says that in
[11-33](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2011.html#33).

_The above chain may be modelled by recognizing commitment to purpose
and recognizing lack of trust as an antonym. The last part about
'getting out of the way' may be asking too much from a model.
Or maybe it can do better as well!_

## How do I keep my bias aside?

[6-9](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%206.html#9)
gives the characteristic of a person who has overcome bias:
Level-headed.

The Lord goes on to describe that state of being,
along with its purpose, starting at
[6-16](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%206.html#16) onwards.

He says that your initiative is His worship. See
[18-47](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2018.html#47).

## Then what is our part in this world?

The Lord says in
[14-19](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%2014.html#19):
The intention is ours. What happens is not, neither are past outcomes.
Our impressions are inside ourselves, given by
[the state of our body](https://rapalearning.com/life-and-liberty/Chapter%202.html#satva_rajas_tamas)
at that point in time.

We can only stay in the present, not in the past or the future.

_Ok, I couldn't discern the model behind the last part of this story._
